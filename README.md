# ForumApp

Forum Application written in Typescript with Express, Prisma(MongoDB) for backend, and vanilla javascript for front-end.
The application has both a console version without data persistence and a database version in which files are distinguished by the "db-" prefix.
Both of these versions share the same models, interfaces and errors specified in "src" folder on program's root directory.
To run the application on port 3000 of your machine, simply run the "db-server.ts" in root directory.
